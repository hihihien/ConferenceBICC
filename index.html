            <h3>“Infrastructural power at global frontiers: prospects for
              conflict and peace”</h3>
            <p>29 November 2022, online via Zoom</p>
            How are we to understand conflicts around infrastructural
            mega-developments in global frontier spaces? Can infrastructures
            forge peace? Large infrastructure corridors integrate ports, roads
            and railways with agricultural lands, energy systems and tourism
            spaces in remote areas. Infrastructural mega-plans like the Chinese
            Belt and Road Initiative are globally discussed, yet their local
            imprint is often overlooked, and local populations tend to be
            rendered invisible. Frontier spaces are projected by planners as
            “empty”. Brochures of prospectors and investors do not mention the
            contestations connected to the implementation of such schemes. Grand
            projects stir high hopes and deep-seated fears among the residents
            in the infrastructure corridors. <br>
            <br>
            On the one hand, entire communities may hope for social betterment -
            formal employment and service contracts, local value addition and
            ready markets for local products. Indeed, these projects arguably
            harness a potential for facilitating local development and peace. In
            some cases, local agents may well succeed to affect positive changes
            in the planning processes. On the other hand, local livelihoods may
            be threatened. Pastoralists, hunter-gatherers and fisherfolk may
            lose grazing, hunting and fishing grounds, small-scale farmers their
            access to arable land, without receiving adequate compensation for
            losses. Social dislocations, exclusions, and dispossessions from
            land lead some to stress colonial continuities. Legal frameworks to
            be applied may be inadequate, contradictory or circumvented. In
            addition,prospects of large-scale development in historically
            marginalised areas may stimulate demands for political recognition.
            Infrastructure schemes may come with multiple forms of violence,from
            discursive, psychological violence to organized violence in the form
            of security operators, and they may meet with armed violence in
            areas that have been fraud with conflict in the past.<br>
            <br>
            The BICC Annual Conference 2022 gathers experts from the social
            sciences and practitioners from development, environment, and peace
            organizations to focus on different types of large scale
            infrastructural projects in various frontier spaces around the
            world. This includes, for example, the China-Pakistan Economic
            Corridor (CPEC) as well as the Lamu Port- South Sudan Ethiopia-
            Transport Corridor (LAPSSET) in East Africa. <br>
            <br>
            The conference presents and compares findings from different cases
            to discuss the factors that render infrastructural mega-projects
            either drivers of violence and conflicts or facilitators of peace. <br>
